</div>
If correctly configured to these parameters, now you are good to go ahead.

### Frontend
The website is written using a javascript framework React.js. For setting up the frontend, please read the following instructions:***

Navigate into the cloned repository and go inside the `Frontend` directory
```
cd Pocket-Tutor
cd Frontend
```
now use `npm` to execute the frontend over your localhost
```
npm run dev
```
### Gemini Assistant
It is written in python and is deployed in the form of an API using FastAPI. It is responsible for processing text, images and documents for providing constructive responses. For setting up the GenAI, please read the following instructions:***

Navigate in the cloned repository and go inside the `gemini_assistant` directory
```
cd Pocket-Tutor
cd gemini_assistant
```
Install the required modules and dependencies using this command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
#### Environment Variables
![241002_18h53m57s_screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f4dc31-5e08-4bae-be98-88d48571fb1e)

Once inside the `gemini_assistant` directory, you need to create a `.env` file insde it to setup the environment variables. Following variables should be inside the file
- `API_KEY`: setup an API from the `Google AI Studio` and paste it for this parameter
- `MONGODB_URI`: use your MongoDB URI to connect to your database
---
Now that your environment variables are all good to go, all you need to do is fire up the API using this command
```
python -m uvicorn deploy:app --reload
```
And you can now use this GenAI API over your localhost **(127.0.0.1:8000)**

### Backend
It is written in a node.js framework called Express.js, and it serves as an medium for the frontend and the generative AI to communicate. For setting up the backend, please read the following instructions:***

Navigate into the cloned repository and go inside the `backend` directory
```
cd Pocket-Tutor
cd backend
```
---
#### Environment Variables
<div align="left">
  
![241002_18h39m16s_screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c38433f7-b6d3-4fd0-a178-39e6a3c8d1e0)
</div>

Once inside the `backend` directory, you need to create another `.env` file insde it to setup the environment variables. Following variables should be inside the file
- `PORT`: set it to the value 3001
- `DB_URI`: use your MongoDB URI to connect to your database
- `API_KEY`: use the same API used for the `.env` in `gemini_assistant` directory and paste it here
---
Now that your environment variables are all good to go, all you need to do is fire up the backend using this command
```
node index
```
And you can now use this backend over your localhost **(127.0.0.1:3001)**
